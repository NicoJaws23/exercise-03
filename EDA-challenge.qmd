## Exercise 03: Explore and Wrangle Data

## Establishing Variable

In this block of code I am creating 3 unique variables based on data in the data-wrangling csv. The variables are BSD (body size dimorphism, ratio of average male to average female body mass), sex_ratio (number of adult females to adult males), and DI (defensibility index, ratio of day range length to home range diameter

```{r}
BSD <- d$Body_mass_male_mean/d$Body_mass_female_mean
BSD
sex_ratio <- d$AdultFemale/d$AdultMales
sex_ratio
DI <- d$DayLength_km/(pi * d$HomeRange_km2)
DI
```
